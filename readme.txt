In order to use this plugin, you just need to copy one of the appropriate shortcodes from the list below. You can paste it into the location where you want the details to appear. This can be in the sidebar, the header, the footer, or even in the middle of the content.

"User Location and IP" plugin uses the <a href="http://ip-api.com" rel="friend" title="IP-API">IP-API</a> website to fetch users details based on their IP address.

Here's the list of various shortcodes provided by the "User Location and IP" plugin:

<code>[useriploc type="ip"]</code>
<code>[useriploc type="continent"]</code>
<code>[useriploc type="country"]</code>
<code>[useriploc type="countrycode"]</code>

<code>[useriploc type="flag" height="auto" width="50px" vertical_align="baseline"]</code>

As for the Flag shortcode, the height, width, and vertical_align attributes are optional. The default values for height and weight are auto and 50px, respectively. For the vertical_align attribute, baseline is the default value.
